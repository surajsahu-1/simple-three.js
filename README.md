## Introduction

This repository contains several projects created using Three.js. Each project explores different aspects of 3D graphics, from basic shapes and animations to more complex scenes and interactions. These projects serve as a learning tool and a showcase of what can be achieved with Three.js.

## Projects

### Project 1: Basic Shapes
